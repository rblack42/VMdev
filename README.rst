THis repository has a simple Ansible provisioning setup for students working on C++ projects in a Ubuntu virtual machine.

To use this setup, open up a console in your VM and do the following:

..  code-block:: bash
 
    $ git clone https://github.com/rblack42/VMdev.git
    $ cd VMdev
    $ ./bootstrap

That is it! When this script finishes, you should have all the necessary tools installed and ready to run. Ansible_ makes tis entire process pretty easy. Even better, you can re-run the script as many times as you like to make sure all tools are installed and ready to go.
